## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. Ingest (`POST /ingest`)
Upload one or more PDF files.  
The API stores metadata and extracts plain text using **PyMuPDF (fitz)**.  
It returns `document_id` for each uploaded contract.

### 2. Extract (POST /extract)

Given a document_id, it extracts and returns structured fields like:

parties[]

effective_date

term

governing_law

payment_terms

termination

auto_renewal

confidentiality

indemnity

liability_cap (number + currency)

signatories[]


### 3. Ask (POST /ask)

Ask a question about the uploaded contract.
The answer is generated using simple keyword search within the stored document text (simulating a RAG approach).


### 4. Audit (POST /audit)

Performs rule-based checks to detect risky clauses, such as:

Auto-renewal with less than 30 daysâ€™ notice

Unlimited liability

Broad indemnity clauses


### 5. Stream (GET /ask/stream)

Simulated streaming (SSE/WebSocket-style) for live token output when asking a question.

### 6. Admin Routes

GET /healthz â†’ Health check

GET /metrics â†’ Basic metrics (docs uploaded, questions asked, etc.)

GET /docs â†’ Swagger/OpenAPI UI
